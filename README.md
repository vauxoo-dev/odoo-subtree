Testing Subtree with Odoo.
---

What is the objective:

- Have a repository with odoo github project.
- Have other repositories just aside the odoo folder.
- Have config file with relative addons-path.
- Have a mini-script to run everything.
- At the end of the day, we will have a repository where.

    ```bash
    $ git clone repository
    $ ./run.sh
    ```

And gual√° all running, considering a requirement.txt for python packages and a
.travis for tests.

It is only a PoC not to be used in production it is just for my internal usage on my PC.

Why not use a simple script?.

I think re-use components is the correct way if it can bring some apporaches.

Where is the documentation that give you the theorical support?
